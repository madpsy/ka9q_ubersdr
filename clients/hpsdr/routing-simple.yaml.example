# Simple HPSDR Bridge Frequency Routing Configuration
# Two-instance setup: Low bands (below 14 MHz) and High bands (14 MHz and above)

# Frequency ranges mapped to specific UberSDR instances
# Split at 20m band (14 MHz)
frequency_ranges:
  # Low bands: 160m, 80m, 60m, 40m, 30m (below 14 MHz)
  # Typically uses loop antennas or low-band optimized antennas
  - name: "Low Bands (160m-30m)"
    min_freq: 100000      # 100 kHz
    max_freq: 13999999    # Just below 14 MHz

  # Typically uses dipoles, beams, or high-band optimized antennas

  #   - max_sessions (maximum unique users globally)
  #   - max_sessions_ip (maximum unique users per IP)
  #   - Wide IQ mode restrictions (iq48, iq96, iq192, iq384)
  # Supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses with CIDR notation
  # Examples:
  #   - "127.0.0.1"           # Single IPv4 address
  #   - "192.168.1.0/24"      # IPv4 CIDR range

  #   - "2001:db8::/32"       # IPv6 CIDR range
  # By default, localhost is bypassed. Add more IPs/ranges as needed.

  #   - "10.0.0.0/8"

  # List of IP addresses or CIDR ranges to trust X-Real-IP header from
  # When requests come from these IPs, the X-Real-IP header will be trusted
  # to contain the real client IP address (useful for reverse proxies)
  # This works in addition to the tunnel server trust mechanism
  # Trusted IPs/ranges:
  #   - Can set X-Real-IP header with the real client IP
  #   - Useful for Caddy, nginx, Cloudflare, or other reverse proxies
  #   - Prevents clients from spoofing their IP via X-Real-IP header
  # Supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses with CIDR notation
  # Examples:
  #   - "127.0.0.1"           # Single IPv4 address (localhost)
  #   - "192.168.1.0/24"      # IPv4 CIDR range (local network)

  #   - "2001:db8::/32"       # IPv6 CIDR range
  #   - "172.17.0.0/16"       # Docker bridge network
  # By default, Docker host gateway is trusted (and tunnel server if configured)
  # Uncomment and add your reverse proxy IPs/ranges as needed
  trusted_proxy_ips:
    - "172.20.0.1"            # Trust Docker host gateway (HPSDR bridge)
  # Additional examples (uncomment to use):

  #   - "192.168.1.100"       # Trust specific proxy server

  # Password-based bypass authentication (optional)
  # When set, clients can provide this password to gain the same bypass privileges
  # as IPs in the timeout_bypass_ips list. This allows remote users to access
  # wide IQ modes and bypass session limits without being on the IP whitelist.
  #
  # Usage:
  #   - WebSocket: Add ?password=yourpassword to the WebSocket URL
  #   - /connection endpoint: Include "password": "yourpassword" in the JSON body
  #
  # Security notes:
  #   - Use a strong, unique password
  #   - Password is transmitted in plain text, so use HTTPS/WSS in production
  #   - Leave empty (or comment out) to disable password-based bypass
  #   - This grants the same privileges as being in timeout_bypass_ips
  #
  # Example: bypass_password: "my-secret-bypass-password-123"
  bypass_password: ""

  # Public IQ modes configuration
  # Controls which wide IQ modes can be accessed without bypass authentication
  # By default, all wide IQ modes (iq48-iq384) require bypass (IP or password)
  # Set any mode to 'true' to make it publicly accessible without authentication
  #
  # Available wide IQ modes:
  #   - iq48: 48 kHz bandwidth (48 kHz sample rate)
  #   - iq96: 96 kHz bandwidth (96 kHz sample rate)
  #   - iq192: 192 kHz bandwidth (192 kHz sample rate)
  #   - iq384: 384 kHz bandwidth (384 kHz sample rate)
  #
  # Note: Standard 'iq' mode (10 kHz) is always publicly accessible
  #
  # Use cases:
  #   - Allow public access to lower bandwidth modes while restricting higher ones
  #   - Enable iq48 publicly for general users, keep iq96+ for authenticated users
  #   - Control server bandwidth usage by limiting public access
  #
  # Example: Allow iq48 publicly but keep others restricted
  # public_iq_modes:
  #   iq48: true
  #   iq96: false
  #   iq192: false
  #   iq384: false
  #
  # Default: All false except 48 KHz (require bypass authentication)

  #   This is the operator contact email displayed to KiwiSDR clients
  #   If not set, defaults to "admin@example.com"
  #   Use this to provide a public contact email separate from your admin email
  #
  # kiwisdr_smeter_offset: Calibration offset for S-meter readings (dBFS to dBm conversion)
  #   This value is added to the baseband power (in dBFS) to convert to approximate dBm
  #   Adjust based on your system's calibration to get accurate S-meter readings
  #   Typical values: 25-35 (default: 30)
  #   Higher values = higher S-meter readings (more sensitive)
  #   Lower values = lower S-meter readings (less sensitive)
  #   Example: If -43 dBFS signals should show as S9 (-73 dBm), offset = -73 - (-43) = -30, so use 30
  #
  # Usage with kiwirecorder.py:
  #   python3 kiwirecorder.py -s your-host -p 8073 -f 14074 -m usb --tlimit 60

  #
  # Use cases:
  #   - Compensate for antenna gain variations across bands
  #   - Adjust for frequency-dependent cable losses
  #   - Calibrate S-meter readings to match real-world signal reports
  #   - Normalize spectrum display across different frequency ranges

  #
  # Transition behavior:
  #   - 0 Hz: Hard cutoff (instant on/off at start_freq and end_freq)
  #   - Non-zero: Smooth linear ramp over the specified width
  #   - Example: transition_hz: 20000 creates a 20 kHz smooth transition on each side
  #
  # Example: If master gain_db = 5.0 and a range has gain_db = 2.0,
  #          signals in that range will have total gain of 7.0 dB

  #
  # Example: 20m band with 350 Hz/bin can clearly see 50 Hz wide FT8 signals!
  # Compare to old 3 kHz/bin where FT8 was averaged out.
  #
  # If you omit these parameters, sensible defaults will be calculated automatically.

  #   2. Incoming requests are checked: does source IP match tunnel server?
  #   3. If yes: trust X-Real-IP header (set by tunnel server with real client IP)
  #   4. If no: use X-Forwarded-For header (standard Caddy proxy behavior)
  #
  # Leave empty if not using the tunnel service (will use X-Forwarded-For)
  # If DNS lookup fails, a warning is logged and X-Forwarded-For is used as fallback

  # When enabled, creates a dedicated spectrum session to monitor the reference tone
  enabled: false

  # Reference tone frequency in Hz (default: 10000000 = 10 MHz)
  # This is the expected frequency of your external reference signal
  # The system will detect the actual frequency and calculate any offset
  # Common reference frequencies: 10 MHz, 25 MHz, or GPS-disciplined oscillator output
  frequency: 10000000

  # Minimum SNR threshold in dB (default: 20)
  # Peaks below this SNR will be ignored to prevent tracking noise
  # Set lower (e.g., 10) for weaker reference signals
  # Set higher (e.g., 30) for very clean environments
  min_snr: 20

  # Maximum frequency drift in Hz (default: 25)
  # Only signals within ±max_drift_freq Hz of the expected frequency will be considered
  # This prevents false locks on nearby interference or unrelated signals
  # Set lower (e.g., 10) for very stable references like GPSDO
  # Set higher (e.g., 50-100) for less stable oscillators or if you expect larger drift
  # Example: If frequency is 10 MHz and max_drift_freq is 25, only signals
  #          between 9.999975 MHz and 10.000025 MHz will be detected
  max_drift_freq: 25

# Rotator Control (rotctl) Integration
# Provides remote control of antenna rotators via Hamlib's rotctld protocol
# Exposes a JSON API for reading position and controlling the rotator
rotctl:
  # Enable rotator control integration (default: false)
  # When enabled, connects to a rotctld daemon and exposes control API
  # When disabled, API endpoints return appropriate "not enabled" responses
  enabled: false

  # Rotctld daemon hostname or IP address (default: localhost)
  # The host where rotctld is running
  # Examples: "localhost", "192.168.1.100", "rotator.local"
  host: "172.20.0.1"

  # Rotctld daemon port (default: 4533)
  # Standard rotctld port is 4533 (rigctld uses 4532)
  port: 4533

  # Update interval in milliseconds (default: 2000)
  # How often to poll rotctld for position updates in the background
  # Lower values = more responsive but more network traffic
  # Higher values = less responsive but lower overhead
  # Recommended: 1000-5000ms depending on your needs
  #   1000ms = very responsive (1 second updates)
  #   2000ms = balanced (2 second updates) - default
  #   5000ms = relaxed (5 second updates)
  update_interval: 2000

  # API password for control operations (optional)
  # This password is required for all POST requests (position changes, commands)
  # GET requests (reading position/status) do not require authentication
  # Use a strong, unique password different from your admin password
  #
  # Behavior:
  #   - If password is set: Full control mode (read + write with authentication)
  #   - If password is empty: Read-only mode (status/position readable, control disabled)
  #   - If enabled is false: All endpoints return "not enabled" responses
  password: ""

  # Park azimuth position in degrees (default: 0)
  # When the park command is executed, the rotator will move to this azimuth
  # instead of using the rotctld park command (which may not be supported by all rotators)
  # Range: 0-360 degrees
  # Common values:
  #   0 = North (default)
  #   180 = South
  #   270 = West
  # The elevation will remain at its current position
  park_azimuth: 0

  # Position Verification (recommended: true)
  # When enabled, the system will:
  # - Track rotator movement to verify it reaches the target bearing
  # - Detect stuck rotators (no movement for 30+ seconds)
  # - Filter out sensor jitter/oscillation (±3°)
  # - Automatically retry failed movements (up to 3 times)
  # - Prevent unnecessary retries while rotator is actively moving
  # This applies to both manual commands and scheduled positions
  # Default: true (enabled for reliability)
  verify_position: true

  # API Endpoints:
  #   GET  /api/rotctl/position - Get current rotator position (no auth)
  #   GET  /api/rotctl/status   - Get detailed status (no auth)
  #   POST /api/rotctl/position - Set rotator position (password required)
  #   POST /api/rotctl/command  - Execute commands: stop, park, reset (password required)
  #
  # Example usage:
  #   # Read position (no password needed)
  #   curl http://localhost:8080/api/rotctl/position
  #
  #   # Set position (password required in JSON body)
  #   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/rotctl/position \
  #     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

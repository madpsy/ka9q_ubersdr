# CW Skimmer Configuration Example
# This file shows how to configure the CW Skimmer client
# Copy this to cwskimmer.yaml and customize for your station

# Enable/disable CW Skimmer client
enabled: false

# CW Skimmer server connection
host: "localhost"
port: 7300

# Your callsign (required for identification)
callsign: "N0CALL"

# Connection settings
reconnect_delay: 5  # Seconds between reconnection attempts
keepalive_delay: 60 # Seconds between keep-alive messages (5 minutes)

# CSV Logging
# Logs all CW spots to CSV files organized by date/band
spots_log_enabled: true
spots_log_data_dir: "cwskimmer_spots"  # Directory for CSV files (relative or absolute)
                                        # If relative: relative to current working directory
                                        # If absolute: used as-is (e.g., /var/log/cwskimmer_spots)
                                        # Files organized as: cwskimmer_spots/YYYY/MM/DD/bandname.csv
                                        # Example: cwskimmer_spots/2024/11/24/20m.csv

# Metrics Logging (JSON Lines format for time-series data)
# Logs CW Skimmer performance metrics (spot counts, WPM stats, etc.)
metrics_log_enabled: true
metrics_log_data_dir: "cwskimmer_metrics"  # Directory for metrics files (relative or absolute)
                                            # If relative: relative to current working directory
                                            # If absolute: used as-is (e.g., /var/log/cwskimmer_metrics)
                                            # Files organized as: cwskimmer_metrics/YYYY/MM/DD/BAND.jsonl
                                            # Example: cwskimmer_metrics/2024/11/24/20m.jsonl
metrics_log_interval_secs: 300              # Write interval in seconds (default: 300 = 5 minutes)
                                            # Metrics snapshots written at this interval for all active bands

# Metrics Summary (Pre-aggregated time-series summaries)
# Aggregates metrics into daily/weekly/monthly/yearly summaries for fast retrieval
metrics_summary_data_dir: "cwskimmer_summaries"  # Directory for summary files (relative or absolute)
                                                  # If relative: relative to current working directory
                                                  # If absolute: used as-is (e.g., /var/log/cwskimmer_summaries)
                                                  # Files organized as: cwskimmer_summaries/{daily,weekly,monthly,yearly}/YYYY/MM/DD/BAND-summary.json
                                                  # Example: cwskimmer_summaries/daily/2024/11/24/20m-summary.json
                                                  # Updated every minute for fast API responses

# PSKReporter configuration
pskreporter_enabled: false
pskreporter_callsign: "N0CALL"  # Defaults to main callsign if not specified
pskreporter_locator: "IO86ha"   # Your grid locator (required for PSKReporter)
pskreporter_antenna: "Loop"     # Antenna description (optional)

# Notes:
# 1. CW Skimmer must be running and configured to accept telnet connections
#    on the specified host:port
#
# 2. CSV logging (if enabled):
#    - Logs all spots to: spots_log_dir/YYYY/MM/DD/bandname.csv
#    - Independent of PSKReporter reporting
#    - Includes: timestamp, callsign, SNR, frequency, band, WPM, comment, country, zones, distance, bearing
#
# 3. Metrics logging (if enabled):
#    - Logs performance metrics to: metrics_log_dir/YYYY/MM/DD/BAND.jsonl
#    - JSON Lines format (one JSON object per line)
#    - Includes: spot counts, unique callsigns, WPM statistics, activity scores
#    - Written at configured interval (default: 5 minutes)
#
# 4. Metrics summaries (if enabled):
#    - Pre-aggregated summaries for fast API responses
#    - Updated every minute
#    - Organized by period: daily, weekly, monthly, yearly
#
# 5. PSKReporter reporting requires valid callsign and locator
#
# 6. The client automatically extracts band information from spot frequencies
#    and calculates WPM from CW Skimmer data

# Rotator Scheduler Configuration
# This file configures scheduled rotator positioning at specific times of day
#
# The scheduler will automatically move the rotator to the specified bearing
# at the configured times. This is useful for:
# - Pointing at different regions at different times of day
# - Following propagation patterns
# - Automated antenna positioning for scheduled operations
# - Tracking the sun's position throughout the day
#
# IMPORTANT:
# - The scheduler only runs if rotctl is enabled in the main config
# - Commands are only sent when the rotator is connected
# - Times are in 24-hour format (HH:MM)
# - Bearings are in degrees (0-360)
# - The scheduler checks every minute, so positions are executed within 1 minute of scheduled time

# Enable or disable the scheduler
enabled: false

# ============================================================================
# SUN TRACKING MODE
# ============================================================================
# Automatically track the sun's azimuth throughout the day
# This is useful for:
# - Gray-line propagation (tracking sunrise/sunset)
# - Solar observation
# - Optimizing solar-powered equipment orientation
#
# When enabled, the rotator will automatically follow the sun's position
# You can still use scheduled positions alongside sun tracking

# Enable sun tracking mode
follow_sun: false

# Track gray line instead of sun directly
# Default: false
# When true, the rotator points perpendicular to the sun (along the gray line/terminator)
# When false, the rotator points directly at the sun
# The gray line is the boundary between day and night on Earth, where enhanced
# propagation occurs during sunrise and sunset periods
follow_greyline: false

# Path mode: "short" or "long"
# Default: "short"
# - "short": Points directly at the sun (or along greyline if follow_greyline is true)
# - "long": Adds 180° to point in the opposite direction (long path propagation)
# This applies to both sun tracking and greyline tracking modes
# Long path is useful for:
# - Accessing regions on the opposite side of the Earth
# - Taking advantage of long path propagation conditions
# - Avoiding local interference by using the back lobe of the antenna
follow_sun_path: "short"

# Update interval in minutes (how often to update rotator position)
# Default: 15 minutes
# Range: 5-60 minutes
# Note: Sun moves ~15° per hour, so 15-minute updates are usually sufficient
follow_sun_step: 15

# Only track sun during daytime hours (between sunrise and sunset)
# Default: true
# Set to false to track sun 24/7 (including when it's below horizon)
daytime_only: true

# Overlap period in minutes (extend tracking before sunrise and after sunset)
# Default: 60 minutes
# This allows tracking during twilight/gray-line periods
# For example, with 60 minutes overlap:
# - Tracking starts 60 minutes before sunrise
# - Tracking continues 60 minutes after sunset
daytime_overlap: 60

# Custom solar events for two separate tracking windows (optional)
# If all four are specified, these override the daytime_overlap setting
# This creates two separate tracking windows: one for sunrise and one for sunset
# Available events: nightEnd, nauticalDawn, dawn, sunrise, sunriseEnd, goldenHourEnd,
#                   solarNoon, goldenHour, sunsetStart, sunset, dusk, nauticalDusk, night
#
# Sunrise window (morning):
# sunrise_start: "nightEnd"        # Start morning tracking at astronomical twilight
# sunrise_end: "goldenHourEnd"     # End morning tracking after golden hour
#
# Sunset window (evening):
# sunset_start: "goldenHour"       # Start evening tracking at golden hour
# sunset_end: "nauticalDusk"       # End evening tracking at nautical twilight

# follow_greyline: true      # Track gray line (perpendicular to sun)
# follow_sun_path: "short"   # Use short path (default)

# Example 6: Long path sun tracking
# enabled: true
# follow_sun: true
# follow_greyline: false     # Track sun directly (not greyline)
# follow_sun_path: "long"    # Use long path (adds 180° to point opposite direction)

# enabled: true
# follow_sun: true
# follow_greyline: true      # Track gray line (perpendicular to sun)
# follow_sun_path: "long"    # Use long path (adds 180° after greyline calculation)
# follow_sun_step: 10
# daytime_only: true
# daytime_overlap: 90
# positions: []
# Note: This points along the greyline but in the opposite direction

# Example 8: Two separate tracking windows (sunrise and sunset)
# enabled: true
# follow_sun: true
# follow_greyline: true
# follow_sun_path: "short"
# follow_sun_step: 10
# daytime_only: true
# sunrise_start: "nightEnd"      # Morning window: astronomical twilight (sun at -18°)
# sunrise_end: "goldenHourEnd"   # Morning window: end after golden hour
# sunset_start: "goldenHour"     # Evening window: start at golden hour
# sunset_end: "nauticalDusk"     # Evening window: nautical twilight (sun at -12°)
# positions: []
# Note: This creates two separate tracking windows with a gap in between

# Example 9: Sun tracking during day, fixed position at night
# enabled: true
# follow_sun: true
# follow_sun_path: "short"
# follow_sun_step: 15
# daytime_only: true
# daytime_overlap: 60
# positions:
#   - time: "night"          # Point north during night
#     bearing: 0
#     enabled: true

# Example 10: Combine gray line tracking with scheduled overrides
# enabled: true
# follow_sun: true           # Track gray line by default
# follow_greyline: true      # Point along gray line (perpendicular to sun)
# follow_sun_path: "short"
# follow_sun_step: 15
# daytime_only: true
# daytime_overlap: 60
# positions:
#   - time: "12:00"          # Override at noon to point at specific target
#     bearing: 45
#     enabled: true
#   - time: "13:00"          # Resume gray line tracking after 1 hour
#     bearing: 180           # (gray line tracking will take over)
#     enabled: false         # Disabled, so gray line tracking continues

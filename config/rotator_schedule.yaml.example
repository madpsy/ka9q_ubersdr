# Rotator Scheduler Configuration
# This file configures scheduled rotator positioning at specific times of day
#
# The scheduler will automatically move the rotator to the specified bearing
# at the configured times. This is useful for:
# - Pointing at different regions at different times of day
# - Following propagation patterns
# - Automated antenna positioning for scheduled operations
#
# IMPORTANT: 
# - The scheduler only runs if rotctl is enabled in the main config
# - Commands are only sent when the rotator is connected
# - Times are in 24-hour format (HH:MM)
# - Bearings are in degrees (0-360)
# - The scheduler checks every minute, so positions are executed within 1 minute of scheduled time

# Enable or disable the scheduler
enabled: false

# List of scheduled positions
# Each entry specifies a time and bearing
positions:
  # Morning - point east for sunrise propagation
  - time: "06:00"
    bearing: 90

  # Mid-morning - point northeast
  - time: "09:30"
    bearing: 45

  # Afternoon - point west
  - time: "14:00"
    bearing: 270

  # Evening - point northwest for sunset propagation
  - time: "18:00"
    bearing: 315

  # Night - point north
  - time: "22:00"
    bearing: 0

# Example configurations for different use cases:

# Example 1: Simple day/night switching
# positions:
#   - time: "08:00"
#     bearing: 90    # East during day
#   - time: "20:00"
#     bearing: 270   # West during night

# Example 2: Following the sun across the sky
# positions:
#   - time: "06:00"
#     bearing: 90    # East at sunrise
#   - time: "09:00"
#     bearing: 120   # Southeast
#   - time: "12:00"
#     bearing: 180   # South at noon
#   - time: "15:00"
#     bearing: 240   # Southwest
#   - time: "18:00"
#     bearing: 270   # West at sunset
#   - time: "21:00"
#     bearing: 0     # North at night

# Example 3: Contest operation schedule
# positions:
#   - time: "00:00"
#     bearing: 0     # North America
#   - time: "06:00"
#     bearing: 90    # Asia
#   - time: "12:00"
#     bearing: 180   # Oceania
#   - time: "18:00"
#     bearing: 270   # Europe

# Example 4: Specific target bearings
# positions:
#   - time: "07:00"
#     bearing: 45    # Point to Japan
#   - time: "14:00"
#     bearing: 315   # Point to USA West Coast
#   - time: "20:00"
#     bearing: 285   # Point to USA East Coast
#   - time: "23:00"
#     bearing: 60    # Point to Australia

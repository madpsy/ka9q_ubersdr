# Rotator Scheduler Configuration
# This file configures scheduled rotator positioning at specific times of day
#
# The scheduler will automatically move the rotator to the specified bearing
# at the configured times. This is useful for:
# - Pointing at different regions at different times of day
# - Following propagation patterns
# - Automated antenna positioning for scheduled operations
# - Tracking the sun's position throughout the day
#
# IMPORTANT:
# - The scheduler only runs if rotctl is enabled in the main config
# - Commands are only sent when the rotator is connected
# - Times are in 24-hour format (HH:MM)
# - Bearings are in degrees (0-360)
# - The scheduler checks every minute, so positions are executed within 1 minute of scheduled time

# Enable or disable the scheduler
enabled: false

# ============================================================================
# SUN TRACKING MODE
# ============================================================================
# Automatically track the sun's azimuth throughout the day
# This is useful for:
# - Gray-line propagation (tracking sunrise/sunset)
# - Solar observation
# - Optimizing solar-powered equipment orientation
#
# When enabled, the rotator will automatically follow the sun's position
# You can still use scheduled positions alongside sun tracking

# Enable sun tracking mode
follow_sun: false

# Track gray line instead of sun directly
# Default: false
# When true, the rotator points perpendicular to the sun (along the gray line/terminator)
# When false, the rotator points directly at the sun
# The gray line is the boundary between day and night on Earth, where enhanced
# propagation occurs during sunrise and sunset periods
follow_greyline: false

# Update interval in minutes (how often to update rotator position)
# Default: 15 minutes
# Range: 1-60 minutes
# Note: Sun moves ~15° per hour, so 15-minute updates are usually sufficient
follow_sun_step: 15

# Only track sun during daytime hours (between sunrise and sunset)
# Default: true
# Set to false to track sun 24/7 (including when it's below horizon)
daytime_only: true

# Overlap period in minutes (extend tracking before sunrise and after sunset)
# Default: 60 minutes
# This allows tracking during twilight/gray-line periods
# For example, with 60 minutes overlap:
# - Tracking starts 60 minutes before sunrise
# - Tracking continues 60 minutes after sunset
daytime_overlap: 60

# SCHEDULED POSITIONS
# ============================================================================

# List of scheduled positions
# Each entry specifies a time, bearing, and enabled state
positions:
  # Morning - point east for sunrise propagation
  - time: "06:00"
    bearing: 90
    enabled: true

  # Mid-morning - point northeast
  - time: "09:30"
    bearing: 45
    enabled: true

  # Afternoon - point west
  - time: "14:00"
    bearing: 270
    enabled: true

  # Evening - point northwest for sunset propagation
  - time: "18:00"
    bearing: 315
    enabled: true

  # Night - point north
  - time: "22:00"
    bearing: 0
    enabled: true

# Example configurations for different use cases:

# Example 1: Simple day/night switching
# positions:
#   - time: "08:00"
#     bearing: 90    # East during day
#   - time: "20:00"
#     bearing: 270   # West during night

# Example 2: Following the sun across the sky
# positions:
#   - time: "06:00"
#     bearing: 90    # East at sunrise
#   - time: "09:00"
#     bearing: 120   # Southeast
#   - time: "12:00"
#     bearing: 180   # South at noon
#   - time: "15:00"
#     bearing: 240   # Southwest
#   - time: "18:00"
#     bearing: 270   # West at sunset
#   - time: "21:00"
#     bearing: 0     # North at night

# Example 3: Contest operation schedule
# positions:
#   - time: "00:00"
#     bearing: 0     # North America
#   - time: "06:00"
#     bearing: 90    # Asia
#   - time: "12:00"
#     bearing: 180   # Oceania
#   - time: "18:00"
#     bearing: 270   # Europe

# Example 4: Specific target bearings
# positions:
#   - time: "07:00"
#     bearing: 45    # Point to Japan
#   - time: "14:00"
#     bearing: 315   # Point to USA West Coast
#   - time: "20:00"
#     bearing: 285   # Point to USA East Coast
#   - time: "23:00"
#     bearing: 60    # Point to Australia

# Example 5: Gray-line tracking for enhanced propagation
# enabled: true
# follow_sun: true
# follow_greyline: true      # Track gray line (perpendicular to sun)
# follow_sun_step: 10        # Update every 10 minutes
# daytime_only: true         # Only track during daytime
# daytime_overlap: 90        # Start 90 minutes before sunrise, end 90 minutes after sunset
# positions: []              # No scheduled positions, just gray line tracking

# Example 6: Sun tracking during day, fixed position at night
# enabled: true
# follow_sun: true
# follow_sun_step: 15
# daytime_only: true
# daytime_overlap: 60
# positions:
#   - time: "night"          # Point north during night
#     bearing: 0
#     enabled: true

# Example 7: Combine gray line tracking with scheduled overrides
# enabled: true
# follow_sun: true           # Track gray line by default
# follow_greyline: true      # Point along gray line (perpendicular to sun)
# follow_sun_step: 15
# daytime_only: true
# daytime_overlap: 60
# positions:
#   - time: "12:00"          # Override at noon to point at specific target
#     bearing: 45
#     enabled: true
#   - time: "13:00"          # Resume gray line tracking after 1 hour
#     bearing: 180           # (gray line tracking will take over)
#     enabled: false         # Disabled, so gray line tracking continues
